## Things to do

- [ ] Add a logger to the project
- [ ] Create file paths to read the data for the model (https://crates.io/crates/strfmt)
- [ ] Rename the TimeStep struct to something more descriptive since it more about daily, weekly, monthly, etc. than time steps.
- [ ] Add the possibility to use a shapefile or something else to define the area of interest and only perform calculations within that area.
